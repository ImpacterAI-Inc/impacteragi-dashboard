## 📊 What to Track

### Usage Metrics:
- Total signups
- Code redemption rate
- Credits used per user
- Most popular tasks
- Time to first task
- Return rate (do they come back?)

### Feedback Questions:
- What worked well?
- What was confusing?
- What features are missing?
- Would you pay for this? How much?
- What task would you use it for most?

### Red Flags to Watch:
- Low credit usage = product not working or unclear value
- High support tickets = UX issues
- No return visits = not sticky enough
- One task type dominates = might need to pivot
